          <p>Fact: the best salsa is made with fresh tomatoes. Okay, that's just my opinion, but in the past I
            thought I could go the route of using all canned tomatoes, but using fresh tomatoes makes a world of
            difference! Fresh tomatoes make the best salsa, especially when you use nicely ripened in season
            tomatoes.</p>
          <p>This is hands down my favorite salsa recipe, and I don't know that I'll ever need another one. It just
            has the perfect ratio and blend of everything.</p>
          <p>It's not too oniony or garlicy, nor too spicy for my kids, it doesn't tasting like it came from a can
            and it has the perfect brightness with the fresh lime. Then it has a classic Mexican flavor with the
            cilantro and hint of chili powder and cumin.</p>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh Roma tomatoes</strong> – use the nice and red ones, avoid anything soft.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong> – I like to use canned in addition to fresh because it gives the
              salsa a better consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Jalapeno</strong> – this adds a nice kick. If you don't like heat you can replace it with
              1/4 cup chopped bell pepper, or omit.</li>
            <li><strong>Red onion</strong> – yellow onion can be used here as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Green onion</strong> – if you don't want to buy both kinds of onions you can omit the green
              onions and add just a little more red onion.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong> – it may seem small but garlic packs a flavorful punch. Only use fresh
              garlic here for best flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Lime</strong> – this really brightens up the salsa.</li>
            <li><strong>Chili powder and cumin</strong> – I don't always add these but they're a nice addition if
              you have them on hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong> – just a touch balances out the acidity of the tomatoes and lime.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> – the salsa would taste flat without the salt and the pepper adds a
          </ul>

            <h4>What if I Don't Own a Food Processor?</h4>
            <p>This salsa can also be made in a blender.</p>
          </aside>
          Making salsa at home couldn't be easier! Here's how you'll make it:
          <ol>
            <li>Roughly chop the vegetables (and fruit if you want to get technical, those tomatoes).</li>
            <li>Add vegetables to a food processor along with spices and lime juice.</li>
            <li>Chop in quick bursts until it's finely chopped up.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Tips for the Best</h3>
          <p>
            It doesn’t get much simpler than this recipe, but there are a few extra tips we wanted to share so you
            can make it your own!
          </p>
          <details>
            <summary>Use the Pulse function</summary>
            <p>For a texture that rivals restaurant-style or jarred salsa, use the pulse function when blending.
              This way, you can dial in the perfect texture. We keep it a little chunky.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Let it sit for 30 minutes or more</summary>
            <p>
              The great news about this recipe is that as the salsa sits, it gets better and better. Time allows all
              the flavors and ingredients to mingle.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Deflame your onions</summary>
            <p>Place chopped onions into a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes. Then we drain and rinse them. This
              simple step takes the edge off of the raw onion.</p>
